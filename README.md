This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
1. Fork or clone this repo to your local machine
2. run npm i && yarn install to load all needed dependencies
3. run npm run test to see if all the tests are working (optional)
4. run npm start
5. The app should redirect you to http://localhost:3000/ to view the app. If you weren't redirected then you should go the that url manually.

## How to interact with the app
To use the album app simply type the name of an artist or album into the search bar at the top and click submit. Then you can peruse through the outputted albums and check out an album's or artist's iTunes profile page.

## Built With
